# Plan: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Overview

{{1-2 sentence description of what will be built}}

## Success Criteria (Project Complete When...)

- [ ] {{Core outcome 1 - measurable, testable}}
- [ ] {{Core outcome 2 - measurable, testable}}
- [ ] {{Core outcome 3 - measurable, testable}}
- [ ] {{All tests passing with >80% coverage}}

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Foundation 📋 Not Started (0%)
**Outcome**: {{What's achieved when this milestone completes - outcome, not tasks}}

Deliverables:
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 1}}
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 2}}
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 3}}

**Risk Focus**: Critical + Unknown (proof-of-concepts, validate assumptions)

### Milestone 2: Integration 📋 Not Started (0%)
**Outcome**: {{What's achieved - usually production-ready with all integrations}}

Deliverables:
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 1}}
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 2}}

**Risk Focus**: Critical + Known (use established patterns, avoid blockers)

### Milestone 3: Polish 📋 Not Started (0%)
**Outcome**: {{What's achieved - usually optimized, documented, deployed}}

Deliverables:
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 1}}
- [ ] {{Concrete deliverable 2}}

**Risk Focus**: Non-Critical (refinements, optimizations)

## Risk Analysis

**Critical + Unknown (Foundation):**
- {{High-impact risk that needs proof-of-concept}}

**Critical + Known (Integration):**
- {{Important risk with established patterns}}

**Non-Critical (Polish):**
- {{Lower priority items or optimizations}}

## Architecture

{{Key architectural decisions - update as implementation progresses}}

- {{Key decision 1}}
- {{Key decision 2}}

## Research Findings

{{Document research that validates specific approaches - tasks can reference these instead of duplicating}}

### {{Research Topic 1}} (e.g., "TypeScript Testing Framework")
**Decision**: {{What was chosen and why}}
**Research**: {{Brief summary of what was evaluated}}
**Validated Approach**:
```{{language}}
{{Proven code/config to use as-is - referenced by tasks}}
```
**References**: {{Links to docs, articles, or internal files}}

### {{Research Topic 2}}

## Task History

**Completed** (in completed/):
- {{List completed tasks as they finish}}

**In Flight**:
- {{Tasks currently in implementation/review/testing}}

**Pending** (current iteration):
- `001-{{task-name}}.md` - {{One line description}}
- `002-{{task-name}}.md` - {{One line description}} (depends: 001)

Status tracked via file location: `pending/` → `implementation/` → `review/` → `testing/` → `completed/`

---

## Next Planning Cycle

**Trigger**: {{When to generate next batch of tasks - usually milestone completion}}

**Actions**:
1. Review learnings from {{current milestone}}
2. Generate {{next milestone}} tasks based on actual architecture
3. Update risk analysis with new findings
4. Review deferred items for relevance

**Expected learnings before {{next milestone}}**:
- {{What you'll discover that informs next planning cycle}}

---

## Deferred Items

**To Milestone 2:**
- {{Item deferred from Milestone 1 with rationale}}

**To Future Milestones:**
- {{Item deferred beyond current milestone with rationale}}

**Eliminated:**
- {{Item deemed unnecessary with rationale}}
