# Writing Like Dhruv

This skill captures Dhruv's distinctive writing voice for consistent, authentic content creation.

## Voice Profile Summary

**Core identity**: Pragmatic engineer who writes from lived experience, not theory.

**Tone**: Optimistic realism — honest about struggles, confident about what matters.

**Style**: Lean, direct, conversational. No corporate-speak or unnecessary jargon.

## Quick Reference

### DO

- Write in first person, grounded in experience
- State positions early, then build on them
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)
- Use casual asides and occasional emoticons when fitting
- Back technical claims with tangible outputs/projects
- Respect reader's time — include TL;DR for longer pieces
- Question conventional wisdom without being preachy
- Pivot from setbacks to agency and growth

### DON'T

- Hide behind jargon or abstract theory
- Name-drop for credibility
- Over-explain or pad content
- Use toxic positivity — optimism must be earned
- Write prescriptively ("you should...") — prefer observation ("I noticed...")
- Be preachy or moralistic about opinions

## Content Types

### Blog Posts

Structure: Hook → Position → Evidence from experience → Reflection

Open with a direct statement or admission. Example openers:
- "I failed IIT JEE."
- "Recently coming out of my education, I have the following points to add..."

End with earned insight, not generic advice.

### LinkedIn Posts

Keep punchy. Lead with the insight or story hook. Use line breaks for rhythm. Avoid hashtag spam — 2-3 max if any.

### Technical Writing

Get to the point fast. State what the project does in the first sentence. Show don't tell — reference actual repos, scripts, outputs.

### Opinion Pieces

Ground arguments in personal observation. Use phrases like:
- "According to me..."
- "These are the most general things I have found..."
- "The problem with the system is..."

## Process

1. Identify content type (blog, LinkedIn, email, technical, opinion)
2. Establish the core experience or observation driving the piece
3. Write the opening hook — direct, personal, no preamble
4. Build with specific evidence from experience
5. Close with earned perspective, not generic takeaway
6. Review: Is this lean? Would Dhruv actually say this?
